### **Event Prediction Ranking Model**

The **Event Prediction Ranking Model** repository is a critical component of the **Log Events Monitoring and Prediction System**, responsible for evaluating and prioritizing event predictions. It ensures that predictions are ranked based on their relevance, confidence, and actionable value, enabling efficient decision-making and downstream utilization.

---

### **Features**
- **Prediction Scoring**:
  - Implements algorithms to assign relevance scores to event predictions.
  - Considers multiple factors such as confidence levels, past trends, and domain-specific metrics.

- **Customizable Ranking Logic**:
  - Supports configurable scoring thresholds and weight assignments for different scoring criteria.
  - Easily integrates new ranking methodologies through modular design.

- **Batch and Real-Time Processing**:
  - Handles ranking tasks for both batch prediction outputs and real-time event streams.
  - Optimized for high throughput and low latency.

- **Integration with the Prediction Pipeline**:
  - Processes predictions from upstream components like **Event Sequence Model** and **EventSpecialist**.
  - Outputs ranked predictions to the **Predicted Events Manager**.

- **Monitoring and Evaluation**:
  - Tracks ranking performance metrics such as processing time, prediction accuracy, and scoring trends.
  - Logs ranking decisions for auditing and debugging.
